// Recognizes: when numberOfTouchesRequired have moved mostly in the specified direction, enough to be considered a swipe.
//             a slow swipe requires high directional precision but a small distance
//             a fast swipe requires low directional precision but a large distance

// Touch Location Behaviors:
//     locationInView:         location where the swipe began. this is the centroid if more than one touch was involved
//     locationOfTouch:inView: location of a particular touch when the swipe began
